# Code Exercise Repository 🚀

This repository contains a collection of coding exercises implemented in Java, Python, and JavaScript. Each exercise is properly coded, and I have taken care to analyze and document their Time complexity ⏱️ and Space complexity 🚀.

## Introduction 📝

As a passionate coder and continuous learner, I created this repository to store my solutions to various coding challenges. These exercises cover a wide range of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. My aim is to sharpen my coding skills and explore different approaches to problem-solving.

## Languages Used 💻
- Java ☕
- Python 🐍
- JavaScript 🟨

## Time and Space Complexity ⏱️🚀

I have made sure to analyze and document the Time and Space complexities of each exercise. Understanding the efficiency of algorithms is crucial for writing scalable and performant code. You can find this information in the respective source files or in the comments provided within the code.

## Contributions 🤝

Contributions to this repository are more than welcome! If you spot any bugs 🐞, optimizations 🚀, or want to add new exercises, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we can build a valuable resource for the coding community.

## Optimization 🔄

As my knowledge continues to grow and I gain more experience, I will revisit the exercises to keep optimizing them further. I am committed to honing my coding skills and learning from the community's feedback. Your insights and suggestions are highly appreciated.

Happy coding! 😊
